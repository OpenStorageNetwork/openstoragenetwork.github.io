The Open Storage Network (OSN) supports science and scholarly research that requires data storage and transfer at scale, by simplifying and accelerating access to data that is in active use by ongoing research projects. 

## Getting Started

Start with the following entrypoints depending on your situation:

- **You're interested in how OSN can enhance your research**: read about [the features and benefits of OSN]({{< relref "why-osn" >}}). 
- **You need an allocation**: for most users, learn [how to get an allocation from the NSF's ACCESS program]({{< relref "allocations" >}}).
- **You want to use your new allocation**: visit the [quick start guide]({{< relref "quick-start" >}}).
- **Your institution is interested in hosting an OSN pod**: see the [Host a Pod page]({{< relref host >}}).
