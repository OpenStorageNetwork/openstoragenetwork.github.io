The OpenStorageNetwork provides S3 storage to researchers through the 
[NSF's ACCESS-CI]({{< param links.access >}}) program. The ACCESS-CI 
program helps researchers and educators use advanced computing systems 
within the United States. ACCESS allocates many types of research 
computing resources at no cost to researchers, including OSN storage.

## Requesting ACCESS-CI Allocations

Researchers can request OSN allocations between 10 and 50 Terabytes (TB) through the 
[ACCESS-CI allocation proposal process]({{< param "links.access-allocations" >}}).
If your project needs more than 50 TB of OSN storage, please 
[contact us]({{< relref "about#contact" >}})
for options, including purchasing an OSN pod for your institution.

ACCESS-CI allocates resoures on a "credit" system. First, a researcher
submits an allocation request to ACCESS for a number of credits
with rationale for how ACCESS resources will help their project. 
Then, the researcher redeems the credits to one or more ACCESS 
resource providers (RPs), including OSN.  

Researchers can redeem ACCESS credits for OSN storage at a rate of 1 ACCESS
credit per 1 GB of OSN storage. To get started, make a request for 
the minimum allocation, 10 TB (10,000 ACCESS credits). 
If you need more space, once you near your quota you can make supplemental
storage requests up to a maximum of 50 TB.

{{< callout note >}}
[ACCESS Campus Champions](https://campuschampions.cyberinfrastructure.org/) may request 1 TB of storage (1,000 ACCESS credits) for testing. Please
include that you are a Campus Champion in your exchange request.

To get started, submit an ACCESS allocation request. If you have not
previously used ACCESS resources, we recommend starting 
with an Explore ACCESS request. 

{{< callout tip >}}
If you're not familiar with the ACCESS process or 
haven't created a project before, ACCESS's helpful
[Get Your First Project Guide](https://allocations.access-ci.org/get-your-first-project)
walks you through the whole process.

### Prepare for your ACCESS allocation request

ACCESS allocation proposal requirements vary depending on the scale
of resources requested. When you submit an allocation request, consider
what your project needs from any
[ACCESS Resource Provider](https://allocations.access-ci.org/resources) 
you intend to use, including OSN. ACCESS provides a 
[summary table](https://allocations.access-ci.org/project-types)
for project types and requirements and detailed 
[proposal requirements](https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests)
for each project type.

{{< callout warning >}}
We'll only address "Expore ACCESS" and "Discover ACCESS" project
types in this guide. The two large project types, "Accelerate ACCESS"
and "Maximize ACCESS," have more stringent proposal requirements
and require a panel review. If you have questions about incorporating
OSN into your large allocation projects, please submit a ticket to
{{% help-email %}}.
{{< /callout >}}

**For small projects or first projects:** submit an "Explore ACCESS" proposal
type for requests up to 400,000 credits. If you're not
sure how much of each resource you need, start here to get a small
allocation for test cases and benchmarking. Requirement: a project
abstract and minimal justification for the resources requested.

**For medium projects with established resource requirements:** 
submit a "Discover ACCESS" (up to 1.5 million credits) proposal.
In order to estimate how many credits you need, first determine how much
of each requested resource your project requires, then use the
[credit exchange calculator](https://allocations.access-ci.org/exchange_calculator)
to convert to ACCESS credits. Requirement: a 1 page proposal outlining 
your project's goals and your need for the specific resources requested.

After you decide on proposal type and ACCESS credit requirements, 
prepare your proposal materials according to the
[ACCESS proposal guide](https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests).

### Request an ACCESS allocation

While logged in to the [ACCESS-CI portal]({{< param links.access >}})...

1. Navigate to `Allocations > My Projects > Request New Project > Request a <project type> project`.
2. Complete the form with the information and documents you gathered above.

Once your project has been awarded ACCESS credits, you can transfer
those credits for OSN storage and other resources. To exchange...

1. Go to the [ACCESS allocations page]({{< param "links.access-allocations" >}}).
2. Click the project you want to exchange credits for to expand the information window.
3. In the `Credits & Resources` tab, select "OSN" from the "Add resource to your exchange" field.
4. Enter the amount of OSN storage you need in TB, minimum 10 TB.
5. Enter reason for the exchange. You should include detailed information for each resource 
   you're requesting, including OSN. For small projects, explaining that you want to evaluate
   OSN for your project is an acceptable exchange reason. 

{{< callout caution >}}
Your first OSN allocation exchange should be 10 TB
of storage. After you demonstrate need and 
usage, you can request supplements up to 50 TB.
{{< /callout >}}

After you submit your project, the OSN team and teams from any other requested
resources will evaluate your request and approve your project. After 
you get an email notification that your project has been approved, you're
ready to log into the [OSN portal]({{< relref portal >}}) and request your buckets.
