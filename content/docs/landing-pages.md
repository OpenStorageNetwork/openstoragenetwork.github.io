Coming Soon! The data set owner may also create a landing page that
follows DOI landing page conventions, making it easy to visit from a
browser or data catalog. The landing page contains metadata that
describes the data set and links to preconfigured, downloadable tools
for accessing the data set. OSN provides tools to create a Basic landing
page that may be overridden by more sophisticated landing pages
depending upon the needs of the End User community. The landing page has
the following generic template.

A completed template example is shown below.
